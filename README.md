# Library Management System

The Library Management System is a robust command-line application developed in C for efficient management of a library's inventory. This system provides a user-friendly interface to librarians, enabling them to perform essential tasks such as adding new books, facilitating book borrowings, processing returns, and maintaining an organized view of the library's collection.
